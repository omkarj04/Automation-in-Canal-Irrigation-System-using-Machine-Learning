We led the creation of an Android app using machine learning to improve canal irrigation. Our app features a user-friendly interface with Admin and User access levels, integrating seamlessly with a database. It includes SVM classification for irrigation issues, real-time water bill payments, complaint submissions, and admin tools for managing payments and users. This project demonstrates my skills in ML, app development, and problem-solving through tech.
